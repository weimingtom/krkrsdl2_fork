Name: Volk Meta loader for Vulkan API
Short Name: volk
URL: https://github.com/zeux/volk

Security Critical: yes

Description:
volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan. It allows you to dynamically load
entrypoints required to use Vulkan without linking to vulkan-1.dll
or statically linking Vulkan loader. Additionally, volk simplifies
the use of Vulkan extensions by automatically loading all associated
entrypoints. Finally, volk enables loading Vulkan entrypoints directly
from the driver which can increase performance by skipping loader
dispatch overhead.

Local Modifications:
Added static variables to track VkInstance and VkDevice that were last loaded by volk.
This data is then used by ANGLE renderer to make sure that the current device/instance
match up with previously loaded values. When they don't match, we re-load vk* function
pointers.
