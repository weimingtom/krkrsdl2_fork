aoTuV Beta 5

"aoTuV" tunes up Xiph.Org's libvorbis uniquely. 
A license is taken as "BSD-style license" as well as original libvorbis. 


# NOTICE #

  Manuke's patch is used for improvement in the speed of sort processing. 
  When "#define OPT_SORT" of "lib/psy.h" is deleted, the conventional 
  processing method is used.
  Thanks! Manuke.


aoTuV based on <Xiph.Org libvorbis>
