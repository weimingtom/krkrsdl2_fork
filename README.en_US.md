# Kirikiri SDL2

Kirikiri SDL2 is a port of [Kirikiri Z](https://krkrz.github.io/) that can be run on platforms supporting [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), such as macOS and Linux.  

This program can be used alongside a modified version of KAG (Kirikiri Adventure Game) 3.  
For more details, please see the following location: https://github.com/krkrsdl2/kag3  

Kirikiri SDL2 can also be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).  
A demonstration project playable in your web browser is available here: https://krkrsdl2.github.io/krkrsdl2/  

## A note on running commercial games

Running unmodified commercial games using this project is not supported.  
Please use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Kirikiroid2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tvp.kirikiri2) instead.

A Matrix bridged channel is also available at [#krkrsdl2:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#krkrsdl2:matrix.org).  

## Download

The following builds are automatically built from the latest source code by Github Actions.  

* [Web build](https://github.com/krkrsdl2/krkrsdl2/releases/download/latest/krkrsdl2-web.zip)
* [macOS build](https://github.com/krkrsdl2/krkrsdl2/releases/download/latest/krkrsdl2-macos.zip)
* [macOS Application Bundle build](https://github.com/krkrsdl2/krkrsdl2/releases/download/latest/krkrsdl2-macos-appbundle.zip)
* [Ubuntu build](https://github.com/krkrsdl2/krkrsdl2/releases/download/latest/krkrsdl2-ubuntu.zip)

## Usage

To use the program, execute it in the command line in the same directory as `startup.tjs`:
```bash
/path/to/krkrsdl2
```

A startup directory or archive can be specified on the command line:
```bash
/path/to/krkrsdl2 /path/to/startup/directory
```

Command line arguments can be specified on the command line:
```bash
/path/to/krkrsdl2 -drawthread=4
```

For the web version, place the files from the Web build and `data.xp3` created by [Releaser](https://krkrz.github.io/krkr2doc/kr2doc/contents/Releaser.html) onto a web server. Once that is done, the project can be accessed from a web browser.  

## Cloning

To clone the repository, please use the following command in a terminal:

```bash
git clone --recursive -b main https://github.com/krkrsdl2/krkrsdl2
```
If you do not use the exact command above, source files will be missing files since the project uses Git submodules.

## Building

This project can be built by using the Meson build system.  
For more information about the system, please visit the following location: https://mesonbuild.com/  

Meson toolchain files can be used to cross compile to different platforms, such as when using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).  
For your convenience, Meson toolchain files are located here: https://github.com/krkrsdl2/meson_toolchains  

## Running

Once you have built this project, change directory to one containing `startup.tjs`.  
After that is done, execute the program: `/path/to/krkrsdl2`
